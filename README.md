### üöÄ **Step-by-Step Setup**

#### 1. **Clone the Finlytic Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/finlytic.git
cd finlytic
```

#### 2. **Install the Dependencies**
Make sure you‚Äôre in the project directory and then install all necessary Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. **Set Up the Database**
Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and set up. Create a new PostgreSQL database for Finlytic:
```bash
# Access PostgreSQL
psql

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE finlytic_db;
```
Update the `settings.py` file in Django with your PostgreSQL credentials.

#### 4. **Run Database Migrations**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 5. **Prepare the Local Models**

Clone the machine learning models (previously cloned and used locally):
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/comethrusws/finlytic-compliance
git clone https://huggingface.co/comethrusws/finlytic-categorize
```

Place them in the `models/` directory within the project folder.

#### 6. **Set Up Huggingface Transformers Locally**
Install the Huggingface libraries to load the models locally:
```bash
pip install transformers
```

In your Django or FastAPI code, load the models as follows:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Load Finlytic-Compliance Model
tokenizer_compliance = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("models/finlytic-compliance")
model_compliance = AutoModel.from_pretrained("models/finlytic-compliance")

# Load Finlytic-Categorize Model
tokenizer_categorize = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("models/finlytic-categorize")
model_categorize = AutoModel.from_pretrained("models/finlytic-categorize")
```

#### 7. **Run the Server**
Once everything is set up, you can run the Django web server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
For the API, if you're using FastAPI, run it using:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
